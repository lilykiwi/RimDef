# RimDef

This is a fork of the [m1st4x/RimDef](https://github.com/m1st4x/RimDef) repo. While that repo is without a license, I'm continuing the work provided in that repo as the tool seems useful. If any contributors aren't okay with this, let me know, and I can remove this repo. Additionally, I haven't introduced a license to this repository, so it's presumably still under the original repo's license. 

My intent with this fork is to generalise the tool a bit, modernise it to .NET Core, fix some outstanding bugs, and use it for mod development.
